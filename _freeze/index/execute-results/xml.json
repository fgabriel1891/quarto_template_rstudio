However, most trait-based approaches to infer community assembly processes focus on a single trophic level. Owing to the matching of traits facilitating interactions between resource and consumer assemblages, the functional trait diversity of different trophic levels is expected to covary in space. However, differential response of consumers and producers to environmental gradients can cause a decoupling of functional diversity between trophic levels, which we coin functional trophic asymmetry. Here, we develop a metric to quantify functional trophic asymmetry (FTA) and use it to infer the processes underpinning multitrophic community assembly, and explore the role of these processes in shaping the topology of ecological networks. \n  \n  **Location:** Neotropics.\n  \n  **Time period:** Present.\n  \n  **Major taxa:** Mammalian frugivores and palms.\n  \n  **Methods:** We use digitally available data on the functional traits, pairwise mutualistic interactions, and geographic distributions of consumers (mammalian frugivores) and their producers (palms) to quantify functional trophic asymmetry for species occurring in the Neotropics. To cover major data gaps between species-level trait and interaction data, we train machine learning models to generate synthetic network data. We then use linear regression models to relate functional asymmetry to variation in climate, and to assess the influence of functional asymmetry on network specialization.\n  \n  **Results:** Our approach generated probabilistic networks across 1,072 grid cells in the Neotropics, revealing networks with a clearly defined modular structure and substantial differences in their functional richness across trophic levels. Functional trophic asymmetry increases from regions of the Neotropics with low precipitation seasonality to regions with high precipitation seasonality. Along this same climatic gradient, network specialization is positively related to functional trophic asymmetry.\n  \n  **Main conclusions:** Our results further suggest that mutualistic interactions between palms and mammals are mediated by matching traits and taxonomic overlap as a key assembly process at the regional scale. We conclude that increased warming and seasonal shifts in precipitation caused by global climate change could disproportionately impact specialist species while increasing functional trophic asymmetry in ecological networks.\n  \nplain-language-summary: |\n  This study explores how differences in functional traits between co-occurring species assemblages of consumer and producers affect ecological network assembly in the Neotropics. By focusing on mammalian frugivores and palms as a case study, we developed a novel metric functional trophic asymmetry (FTA) to measure mismatches in trait diversity between trophic levels. Using machine learning and statistical models to agument spatially sparse data on species interactions, we found that FTA increases in areas with high precipitation seasonality and leads to more specialized ecological networks. The results suggest that climate change could disproportionately impact specialist species and increase FTA, altering the structure of species interactions in these ecosystems.\ndate: today\nbibliography: references.bib\ncitation:\n  container-title: Manuscript in Progress\nnumber-sections: true\n---\n\n\n\n\n# Introduction\n\nEcologists often examine patterns of functional trait diversity to\ninvestigate community assembly processes [@ackerly2003community;\n@kraft2015community]. To date, however, trait-based approaches in\necology often focus on a single trophic level, whereas approaches that\nconsider multiple trophic levels remain rare [@lavorel2013novel;\n@seibold2018necessity]. An approach that considers processes operating\nwithin and between trophic levels is necessary to better understand the\nassembly of multitrophic communities[@allesina2008general;\n@marjakangas2022trait; @saravia2022ecological]. Moreover, considering\ntrophic interactions while studying community assembly could shed new\nlight on processes underpinning ecological networks\n[@allesina2008general] .\n\nClassical approaches to study community assembly rely on the concept of\nenvironmental filtering, sorting or selection, where density independent\nconditions constrain the functional richness of species assemblages\n[@laliberte2010distance; @villeger2008new;\n@hillerislambers2012rethinking; @kraft2015community]. Functional\nrichness refers to the variability and relative frequency of different\nfunctional traits observed in a community. It is often used to estimate\nthe strength of selection imposed by the environment\n[@kraft2008functional; @kraft2010functional; @kraft2015community]. High\nfunctional richness can indicate weak environmental selection whereas\nlow functional richness can indicate strong selection\n[@kraft2008functional; @halpern2008functional; @paine2011functional]. In\na multitrophic context, the effects of environmental selection can\ncascade across trophic levels such that selection on consumer traits can\nshape the functional richness of their resources, modulated by their\ndegree of reciprocal dependency or co-evolution [@lavorel2013novel;\n@guzman2019towards]. Moreover, the same environmental gradient could\nexert selective pressures of different strength on communities at\ndistinct trophic levels [@marjakangas2022trait]. Differences in the\nstrength of selective pressure among trophic levels could then possibly\nconstrain the structure or topologies of trophic networks\n[@bluthgen2007specialization; @schleuning2012specialization;\n@dehling2020similar].\n\nInferring the relative strength of environmental selection between\ntrophic levels requires using high-dimensional approaches that are able\nto deal with sparse observations for a large number of species\n[@rohr2010modeling; @strydom2022food]. We introduce the concept of\nfunctional trophic asymmetry (FTA), which allows inferring the relative\ninfluence of environmental selection and trait matching on the\ncomposition of multitrophic assemblages [(Figure 1)](Figure%201). FTA is\nthe difference in the richness of interaction-relevant traits between\ntrophic levels in a multitrophic network. FTA can occur because traits\nmediating species interactions (i.e., interaction niches) across trophic\nlevels can also mediate the responses of species to their abiotic\nenvironment (i.e. environmental niches) [@mccain2014body;\n@moretti2009combining; @nagy2018arthropod; @dehling2020similar]. As an\nexample, plant seed size determine the outcome of animal-mediated seed\ndispersal [@donoso2017complementary; @donoso2020downsizing] as well as\nphysiological limits, such as tolerances of plant seedlings to\ndesiccation [@hoekstra2001mechanisms]. High FTA could indicate\ndifferences in the strength of environmental selection over the\ninteraction niches of distinct trophic levels within a multitrophic\nspecies assemblage. Alternatively, low FTA could indicate that the\nstrength of the environment selection shaping interaction niches is\nsimilar between trophic levels, e.g. equally weak or equally strong\n[@marjakangas2022trait]. When interactions between producers and\nconsumers are mutualistic, low FTA could also emerge under strong trait\nmatching and therefore indicate the influence of trait-coevolution\nduring multitrophic community assembly [@dehling2014functional;\n@albrecht2018plant]. By studying spatial variation in functional trophic\nasymmetry along environmental gradients, we could possibly identify the\nconditions promoting environmentally versus cross-trophic interaction-\ndriven community assembly [@schleuning2020trait; @bello2023analyzing].\n\nFrameworks linking multitrophic functional diversity to network topology\nalong broad-scale environmental gradients are crucial to understand the\neffects of global change on biodiversity and ecosystem function\n[@bello2023analyzing; @dehling2018structure; @schleuning2020trait;\n@schleuning2014ecological; @schleuning2023animal]. Functional responses\nof consumer and producer assemblages to climate influence functional\nrichness at the level of the multitrophic community\n[@garcia2018frugivore]. Because some of these traits are involved in\ninteractions across trophic levels, the filtering of traits along\nenvironmental gradients could constrain the number of unique\ninteractions and therefore, network topology [@marjakangas2022trait;\n@emer2020seed; @albrecht2018plant]. As an example, low multitrophic\nfunctional richness could influence emergent patterns in network\nstructure such as the specialization of multispecies interactions by\nlimiting the relative availability of interaction partners across\ntrophic levels [@bluthgen2007specialization; @bluthgen2006measuring].\nWhile high levels of network specialization represent networks\npredominantly made of “one-to-one” interactions, low levels of network\nspecialization represent networks with species showing predominantly\n“one-to-many” interactions [@bluthgen2006measuring;\n@bluthgen2011functional] (Figure 1B). One highly expected outcome is\nthat when functional trophic asymmetry is high, networks will have low\nspecialization. For example, take a plant community exhibiting a low\nrichness of flower displays and which is associated with a bee community\n(pollinators) exhibiting a wide variety of proboscis lengths. These\nplants are unlikely to form “one-to-one” interactions with only a subset\nof bee species that have matching proboscis length. Otherwise,\nnon-matching pollinators would have no food resource and be extirpated.\nBy partitioning deviations from expected FTA and network specialization\nrelationships with null models, one can separate the relative influences\nof processes operating between trophic levels (e.g. trait matching) and\nthose within trophic levels (e.g. environmental selection) in network\nassembly [@marjakangas2022trait]. However, the relationship between\nnetwork specialization and functional trophic asymmetry has not been\nfully explored.\n\nPreserving mutualistic interactions between palms and their mammalian\nfrugivores is important to sustain biodiversity and ecosystem function\nin the tropics [@bogoni2020extent; @marques2022mutualism]. Mammalian\nfrugivores facilitate the dispersal of palm fruits, which helps to\nprevent local extinctions amid disturbance and to maintain biodiversity\nin these ecological networks [@acevedo2020sampling;\n@messeder2020searching; @dehling2018structure]. Exploring patterns of\nco-variation in the functional richness of palm and frugivore\nassemblages along environmental gradients is a first step in this\ndirection. Here, we ask (1) which climatic variable(s) best explains\nvariation in the functional richness of palms vs mammal frugivores, (2)\nwhether differences in these relationships lead to functional trophic\nasymmetry, (3) where does functional asymmetry peaks in the Neotropics\nand (4) whether asymmetry relates to network specialization.\n\n\n![Figure 1: This conceptual model illustrates the dynamic relationship between\nfunctional diversity metrics—specifically Functional Richness (FR) and\nFunctional Trait Asymmetry (FTA)—and environmental gradients within\necological networks. The left panel of **Figure A** visualizes the\nvariation in FR for producers (depicted in green) and consumers\n(depicted in orange) along an environmental gradient. As the\nenvironmental gradient intensifies (e.g., through changes in\ntemperature, precipitation, or habitat fragmentation), FR for both\nproducers and consumers generally declines. However, this decline can\noccur at different rates, leading to two scenarios: (1) **Differential\nDecline in FR**: If consumer FR declines more sharply than producer FR,\na substantial increase in Functional Trait Asymmetry (FTA) occurs. (2)\n**Parallel Decline in FR**: Alternatively, if both producer and consumer\nFRs decline at a similar rate, FTA remains relatively constant along the\ngradient. This scenario indicates a balanced impact of environmental\nchanges across trophic levels, preserving the relative functional\nrelationship between producers and consumers. **Figure B** shifts focus\nto the implications of changing FTA on network specialization—a measure\nof how distinct or generalized interactions are between producers and\nconsumers within ecological networks. **Higher Specialization**: This\nscenario, shown on the left side of the gradient, involves more distinct\nproducer-consumer interactions, where specific consumer species interact\nwith particular producer species. This high specialization often\ncorrelates with low FTA, where the functional traits between interacting\nspecies are closely aligned. **Lower Specialization**: As environmental\nstress increases, leading to a higher FTA, the network may shift towards\nlower specialization. In this state, interactions become more\ngeneralized, with consumers utilizing a broader range of producers due\nto the loss of specific functional\ntraits.](Main_figures/00_Figure1.png){fig-align=\"center\" #fig:fig1}\n\n\n# Methods\n\nIn this study, we investigated the variation of functional trophic\nasymmetry and network specialization along climatic gradients by\ngathering species-level information on traits, interactions, and\ndistributions from literature, museum specimens, and field collections.\nThe collected data were then processed to create synthetic networks\nacross gridded regions of the Neotropics and to calculate functional\ntrophic asymmetry and network specialization variables, followed by\nusing climate data to explain the variation in these variables across\nthe Neotropics (Figure S1).\n\n## Study system\n\nWe focused on multitrophic communities of Neotropical palms and their\nmutualistic, seed dispersing, mammalian frugivores. Palms\n(Plantae:Arecaceae), being a keystone plant family in tropical regions\n[@kissling2012towards; @onstein2017frugivory], provide fruit resources\nto a wide variety of vertebrate frugivores, including birds and mammals\n[@munoz2019synthesis; @zona1989review]. Frugivore mammals\n(Animalia:Mammalia) are among the most important palm-seed dispersers,\nparticularly over long distances. Most frugivore mammals feeding on\npalms are seed eaters and pulp eaters, dispersing palm seeds mostly via\nectozoochorus dispersal [@messeder2020searching]. Importantly,\nfrugivory-related traits have notably underlain palm diversification and\nplayed a key role in the evolution of palm traits\n[@onstein2014diversification; @onstein2017frugivory]\n\n## Data collection\n\n### Species level geographic distribution data\n\nWe obtained binary species distribution data (present/absent) on palms\nfrom the geographic range maps of [@bjorholm2005environmental] and on\nmammals from the IUCN (International Union for the Conservation of\nNature) data portal. To generate local gridded multitrophic species\nassemblages across the Neotropics, we intersected the species-level\nrange maps with a spatial grid where each grid cell represented every 1\nby 1 degree latitude and longitude change along the extent of the entire\nNeotropics. We then listed all palm and mammal frugivore species\nco-occurring in each grid-cell as our grid-cell level multitrophic\nassemblage.\n\n### Species level trait data\n\nWe collected species-level multitrophic trait data related to the\nphysiological tolerance of palms and frugivorous mammals to the abiotic\nenvironment and to their mutualistic interactions. For palms, we\nextracted data from the PalmTraits 1.0 dataset\n[@kissling2019palmtraits]. We collected data on growth form, maximum\nstem height, and average fruit length. For frugivorous mammals, we\nobtained trait data from the EltonTraits 1.0 database\n[@wilman2014eltontraits]. We selected data on body mass, diet, and daily\nactivities. Diet data from the EltonTraits 1.0 database is coded as\npercentage use distribution across ten diet categories. We excluded from\nour analysis species without fruit in their diet. Activity was coded as\na dummy variable with three categories (Diurnal, Crepuscular,\nNocturnal). Finally, body mass was coded as a numerical variable in kg.\nWe excluded bats from the analysis as almost no Neotropical bat species\nis feeding on palm fruits [@messeder2020searching]. In total, we subset\nfrom this dataset the species with available distribution range map,\nthat is 494 palm species and 737 mammal frugivores.\n\n### Pairwise species level interaction data\n\nWe used data on seed dispersal interactions between palms and mammals\nfor the Neotropics, originating from recollections of seed dispersal\nrecords found in the published literature and interaction records are\nrecorded at the species level [@munoz2019synthesis]. Each pairwise\nspecies interaction record reflects where an article mentions the fruit\nor the seed of a palm being dispersed, carried or defecated by a\nfrugivorous mammal. Interaction records collected in this database were\npreviously vetted to reflect effective seed dispersal interactions,\nwhile avoiding those that reflect mere seed consumption (vetting\ncriteria found in: [@munoz2019synthesis]). In total, we gathered a total\nof 581 interaction records between 69 palms and 111 frugivore mammals.\n\n### Grid-cell level environmental data\n\nWe used bioclimatic variables from WorldClim [@fick2017worldclim] to\nrepresent large-scale spatial and temporal variation of climate in the\nNeotropics. Specifically, we used mean annual temperature (BIO01), total\nannual precipitation (BIO12), temperature seasonality (BIO04) and\nprecipitation seasonality (BIO15). Using a moving window, we compute\nsimple averages for every set of bioclimatic records at each grid cell,\nthereby re-scaling the spatial resolution of bioclimatic variables to 1\nby 1 degree grid resolution from their original resolution (1 by 1 km2)\nto match the spatial resolution of our grid cell species-level data.\n\n### Continental level biogeographical data\n\nThe Neotropics is a region with a rich evolutionary history which\nsignificantly influenced patterns of species colonization and extinction\nacross neotropical plant and animal species [@whiteman2015into;\n@antonelli2011there] . The biogeographic regionalization patterns of\n[@morrone2014biogeographical] distinguish seven major biogeographic\nregions (i.e., biogeographic dominions), we use them to delineate the\nspatial extent of species pools when simulating network assembly\nprocesses.\n\n## Statistical analyses\n\n### A probabilistic continental metaweb\n\nHere, we fitted latent variable models that vary in their assumptions to\nestimate interaction probabilities from observed binary data on species\ninteractions. Specifically: the stochastic block model (SBM), the\nconnectance model, the trait-matching model, and the matching-centrality\nmodel [@terry2020finding]. The SBM assumes that ecological networks are\nmodular, with species interacting more within their groups, and outputs\nan two incidence matrix for palm and mammal species group affiliations,\nand a squared matrix (Theta matrix) for interaction probabilities. The\nconnectance model posits that interactions of specialist species are\nsubsets of those of generalist species, optimizing connectivity scores\nto recreate observed network patterns. The trait-matching model assumes\nnon-random species interactions determined by trait differences,\noptimizing parameters along latent-trait axes. The matching-centrality\nmodel combines connectivity scores and latent-trait axes\n[@terry2020finding]. We fitted these models to our available interaction\ndata and selected the model that best predicted the observed continental\npattern of seed dispersal interactions. Using Youden’s J as a metric\nthat balanced model sensitivity and specificity [@poisot2023guidelines],\nwe find that SBM was the best supported model (Figure S2 A-C).\nAdditional details about the model assumptions are explained in\n***Supplementary Text S1**.*\n\n### Downscaling the continental metaweb to generate grid-cell level networks\n\nThe digitally availability of primary biodiversity data on palms and\ntheir mammalian frugivores was imbalanced, with well covered data in\nterms of distribution ranges, followed by well covered data on species\ntraits, to a limited number of interaction records. Therefore, to\ndownscale our initial metaweb to include interactions between between\nevery potentially co-occurring palms and mammal frugivore at every\ngridcell of the Neotropics, we use a two fold approach. First, we\nemployed multinomial logistic regression models that aimed to predict\nthe species level SBM model results (i.e. group affiliations) from\nspecies-level trait data. We justify the choice of multinomial logistic\nregression models as these can handle the prediction of non-binary\noutcomes, that is in our case, the labeling of SBM groupings per\nspecies. We fitted separate multinomial models for palms and mammal\nfrugivores using a label backpropagation algorithm and a neural network\nengine, with 75% of the data allocated for training and the 25%\nremaining for testing. We used neural networks because they are useful\nwhen dealing with multicollinearity, as they can learn complex and\nnon-linear relationships and interactions among predictor variables.\nThis allowed us to separate the relative importance of distinct matching\ntraits on SBM group affiliations. We extracted variable importance\nscores based on the combinations of the absolute values of the best fit\nmodel weights [@gevrey2003review]. Second, we considered as local\npairwise species interaction probabilities as the product of the values\nfrom the Theta matrix from the SBM model that represent the latent\ninteraction probabilities between species pairs within and between\ngroups multiplied by their probability of co-occurrence (POC) in a\ngridcell. To represent species’ co-occurrence probabilities, we used the\nreciprocal distance between the centroids of species pair ranges within\nthe grid-cell, divided by the sum of its range areas within the\ngrid-cell. This implied that within each grid cell, species with closer\nrange centroids and larger cumulative areas are more likely to co-occur\nand interact. This approach allowed us to recreate synthetic\nprobabilistic plant-mammal frugivore networks for each grid-cell across\nthe Neotropics, while accounting for the heterogeneity of species ranges\nwithin each grid.\n\n### Measuring Functional Trophic Asymmetry (FTA) and Network Specialization (H2')\n\nWe computed Functional Trophic Asymmetry (FTA) from the results of the\nSBM model fit. Specifically, from the matrices representing the\nincidence of palm or mammal frugivore species in one of the SBM\ngroupings. Thus, as our measure of functional richness, we calculated\nthe number of species of each taxon across SBM groups per grid. Because\nwe had differences in the total number of palm and mammal species across\ngrids, we normalized species counts within gridcells. We then computed\nthe absolute difference between trophic levels to obtain a measure of\nFTA for each combination of SBM groups. Because we had the potential for\neach palms and mammals species at each grid to become affiliated to any\nof 7 SBM groups, and to interact with any species of the opposite\ntrophic level within and between groups, we obtained a total of 49\nindependent FTA measures for each gridcell, one for each palm-mammal\ngroup combination.\n\nWe measured network specialization at each grid cell using the metric\nH2’. H2’ is a network-level index that describes the degree of\nspecialization of interactions between species\n[@bluthgen2007specialization]. High values indicate networks that are\nmore specialized, meaning that specialist species from one trophic level\ninteract with specialist species from the opposite trophic level. Low\nH2’ values indicate networks among generalists, meaning that there is a\nlow specificity of interactions between species across trophic levels.\nBecause inferred networks varied in their network size (i.e., number of\nunique interactions between palms and mammals), we rarefied the\ncomputation of H2’to networks of the same absolute size per gridcell,\nresampling networks to the same number of pairwise interactions (100) at\neach grid-cell 999 times [@terry2020finding]. We selected the median of\nthis H2’ distribution as our gridcell level measure of network\nspecialization.\n\nWe assessed the deviance of ‘observed’ FTA and H2’ from null models that\nsimulated stochastic community assembly processes [@dormann2009indices].\nWe created these null models by constructing networks of interactions\nbetween a randomized set of palms and mammals for each gridcell and\ncomputing expected values of FTA and H2’. To do this for a given\ngridcell, we identified their biogeographic domain (from\n[@morrone2014biogeographical]) and randomly sampled 10 palm and mammal\nspecies, ensuring each species is selected only once. To this subsampled\nspecies set, we used the same procedures to calculate FTA and H2’ and\nreplicated the process 999 independent times to obtain a distribution of\nexpected FTA and H2’ values. Finally, we computed the deviance between\nobserved and expected values with Z-scores.\n\n### Assessing the influence of climate in Functional Trophic Asymmetry\n\nWe fitted linear regression models to investigate the influence of\nclimate to Functional Trophic Asymmetry. We used FTA z-scores as\nresponse variables and the four climatic predictor variables: Mean\nAnnual Temperature (Temp), Total Annual Precipitation (Prec),\nTemperature Seasonality (TS), and Precipitation Seasonality (PS) as\npredictor variables. In addition, we included the identity of the SBM\npalm-mammal group combination as an interaction term. Prior to fitting\nthe models, we scale-transformed the climatic variables such that they\nall share the same mean but only differ in their standard deviation.\n\n### Assessing the influence of Functional Trophic Asymmetry in Network Specialization\n\nWe fitted linear regression models to investigate the effects of\nFunctional Trophic Asymmetry in Network specialization. We used the\naverage (mean) and standard deviation (sd) of FTA across all gridcells\nand SBM combinations as our predictor variables. By including both as\npredictors, the model accounts for not only the overall asymmetry but\nalso its distribution among SBM groupings. We used the rarefied gridcell\nrecords of H2’ as our response variable. To asses model significance, we\ncompared the estimates of this model to a distribution of expected model\ncoefficients from fitting the same linear model for each of the null\nnetwork assembly replicates.\n\n# Results\n\n## The structure of mutualistic networks between palms and their mammalian frugivores across the Neotropics\n\nThe SBM model organized the continental set of palm and mammal species\ninto a matrix sorting species into seven SBM groups and an accompanying\nmatrix that quantified interaction probabilities between and within\ngroups. In our model, there was a 1.74 fold increase in the likelihood\nof interactions between species within SBM groups rather than between\nSBM groups (Figure 2A). For palms, important trait variables that\npredicted SBM group affiliation were palm fruit length, maximum stem\nheight, and palm growth form (*Acaulescent* or *Erect*) (Figure S3-A).\nFor mammals, important trait variables to predict species group\naffiliations were mammal activity, the logarithm of the *body mass*, and\npercentage of frugivory on diet as predictor variables (Figure S3-B).\nThese analysis revealed that SBM group assortments represent communities\nof palms (Figure S4) and mammal frugivores (Figure S5) with unique trait\ncombinations within the high-dimensional multitrophic spectrum of\ninteraction-relevant traits. Our approach to downscale a continental\nmetaweb was able to generate probabilistic networks between palms and\nmammalian frugivores for 1,072 grid cells acrosss the Neotropics. Each\nnetwork had in average nine interaction partners per species (sd =\n5.62), 27 mammals per grid cell (sd = 14.97), and 11 palms per grid cell\n(sd = 11.42).\n\n\n\n\n![Figure 2: Spatial distribution of **(A)** FTA z-score (mean) and **(B)** H2'\nnetwork specialization index across the Neotropics. Panel A depicts the\ngeographic variation in the mean z-scores of the Functional Trophic\nAsymmetry (FTA). Areas with higher z-scores indicate greater asymmetry\nin the richness of interaction relevant traits between trophic levels,\nwhereas lower scores suggest more balanced trait distributions.

This panel reveals\nsignificant latitudinal gradients, particularly marked in the Andes and\nthe Southern\nCone.](Main_figures/00_network_maps.tif.png){fig-align=\"center\"  #fig:fig2}\n\n\n\n## Differences in trait-climate relationships across trophic levels lead to Functional Trophic Asymmetry\n\nFTA z-scores [(Figure 2B)](#fig2) indicate that in average FTA was less than the\nFTA expected from a null assembly model.  Out of the 49 SBM group combinations,\nthose with less than expected asymmetries are generally between palms in\ngroups 1, 2, and 5 and mammals in groups 6 and 3. Conversely,\ncombinations with significantly greater than expected asymmetries are\ngenerally found between palms in SBM groups 6 and 4 and mammals in SBM\ngroups 1, 2, and 5. FTA peaks in tropical and mountainous regions while\nbeing lower in more temperate areas of the Neotropics, and remains\nstable throughout tropical and humid regions (Figure 2A). The results of\nour linear model shows significant differences in FTA among SBM groups.\nIn addition, it shows a relationship between the spatial variation of\nclimate and FTA. However, the significance and direction of effects vary\nas a function of the SBM group combinations (Figure 3B, Table 1). While\nthe overall fixed model estimates do not show significant effects of\nclimatic variation in FTA across all SBM group combinations \\[Temp (Mean\nannual temperature) ( 𝞫 =0.0051, p=0.859), Prec (Total annual\nprecipitation) ( 𝞫 =−0.0364 p=0.384), TS (Temperature Seasonality) (𝞫\n=−0.0180 p=0.746), and PS (Precipitation Seasonality) (𝞫 =−0.0507\np=0.250)\\]; for specific group combinations, FTA is significantly\npredicted by climate, particularly by changes in Precipitation\nSeasonality (Figure S6). Approximately 59% of the variability in the FTA\nz-score is explained by the linear model with our climate predictors as\nfixed effects and SBM group identity as interaction terms (adjusted\nR-squared = 0.59).\n\nOn one hand, group combinations exhibiting a positive relationship\nbetween FTA and precipitation seasonality are characterized by a\nrelatively stable functional richness of mammals across gradients of\nprecipitation seasonality, while the functional richness of palms\nincreases under these conditions (Figures S6, S7). A significant portion\nof this pattern can be attributed to turnover within the palm community\nof SBM group 6, which predominantly consists of small to medium-sized\ndrupes or berries. These palms, which belong to genera such as\n*Acrocomia*, *Allagoptera*, and *Astrocaryum* are typically of tropical\norigin and display diverse growth forms, including both erect and\nacaulescent. Conversely, group combinations showing a negative\nassociation between FTA and precipitation seasonality are primarily\ndriven by patterns in the palm community of SBM group 5 (Figures S6,\nS7). In this scenario, while the functional richness of mammals remains\nstable, the functional richness of these palms, generally characterized\nby species with erect growth forms and large fruits, increases in\nregions with low precipitation seasonality.\n\n![Figure 3: **(A)** Heatmap depicting the interaction probability among various\nmultitrophic communities across different SBM (Stochastic block model)\ngroups.

In addition, there was a\nsignificant relationship between aggregated gridcell records of\nFunctional Trophic Asymmetry and H2' metric. Specifically, FTA z-scores\nincreased H2’ by 3.28 units per mean unit increase across all SBM\ngroups. Additionally, the standard deviation of FTA z-scores decreased\nH2’ by 1.01 units per unit increase across all SBM groups (SD FTA).\nWhile this linear model explained only around 8.7% of the total spatial\nvariability in H2’ (adjusted R-squared = 0.087), the results of our\nsimulations show that the intercept and slope estimates are\nstatistically significant from null assembly models (Figure S7).\n\n\n\n\n# Discussion\n\nBy making use of digitally available primary biodiversity data\nat broad scales, our approach provides novel insights into the assembly of mutualistic networks. By identifying species clusters of palms and mammals with\nsimilar interaction patterns, we  offer a more nuanced understanding\nof network assembly dynamics within these multitrophic communities. The distribution of Functional Trophic Asymmetry (FTA) across different climatic\nregions of the Neotropics underscores the importance of contemporary\nclimate change in shaping interaction niches across species'\ndistributional ranges, with precipitation seasonality emerging as a\nkey predictor of FTA for certain SBM palm and mammal group combinations,\nwhere higher FTA increase overall network specialization.\n\nThe delineation of interactions into distinct groups indicates that, at\na continental scale, the network of seed dispersal interactions is\nhighly compartmentalized. This finding aligns with previous work\nreporting significant modularity in palm seed dispersal interactions\nacross the Neotropical continent [@munoz2019synthesis]. In our study, we\nextend this understanding by identifying palm growth form and mammal\nforaging activity periods as key palm and animal traits driving this\nbroad scale modularity through changes in functional richness. Clusters of similarly interacting species obtained from SBM models such as ours\nhave been shown to reflect spatio-temporal segregation of species assemblages and the\ndifferentiation of interaction niches [@durand2023trait]. The observed distribution\nof interaction probabilities within and between SBM groups highlights\nmultitrophic assemblages being central to the entire metaweb, notably\nthe palm and mammal species in SBM groups 5 and 6, which are those with\nextensive distributional ranges and more generalist diets. Conversely,\nit also identifies peripheral groups, such as species in SBM groups 1-3,\nwhich exhibit narrower interaction niches. These peripheral species\nassemblages may correspond to those species with restricted ranges\nor specialized diets. Indeed, SBM groups 5-6 include larger, nocturnal\nmammals that feed on palms with varying fruit sizes and growth forms,\nranging from erect to acaulescent, whereas SBM groups 1-3 predominantly\nconsist of smaller, diurnal mammals that consume small fruits from erect\npalms.\n\nOur linear model highlights Precipitation Seasonality as a key factor predicting the Functional Trophic Asymmetry (FTA) in key SBM groupings. This suggests\nthat spatial variation in interaction niches emerges from the\ndifferences in the strength of environmental selection between trophic\nlevels. Such uneven pressures result in multitrophic assemblages where\nnot all co-occurring trait combinations align optimally with the global preferences\nbetween species interaction partners, thus contributing to promote\nstructural diversity in seed dispersal networks across Neotropical\nsites. For example in SBM groups 1-3, mammalian frugivores, which can exhibit a broad\ntolerance for varying levels of precipitation seasonality, may\npredominantly consume small-fruited palms in regions with high\nprecipitation seasonality. This is likely because palms with smaller\nfruits are better adapted to thrive under conditions of variable water\navailability. Consequently, increased aridity (e.g. due to climate change) is expected to result in increased FTA, driven by the restricted functional richness of\navailable resources for consumers. In SBM groups 5-6, palms with larger fruit\nsizes and predominantly erect growth forms consumed by large sized\nfrugivores might reflect adaptations to attract high quality animal seed\ndisperses in environments where consistent water availability promotes\nhigher habitat complexity and plant competition. Consequently, increased aridity is expected to result in increased FTA, but this time driven by the restricted functional richness of available consumers relative to producers. In both cases, FTA imposes limits over trait matching between partners of distinct trophic levels and the partitioning of interaction niches within species of the same trophic level.\n\nThe a low degree of specialization observed for palm-mammal frugivore seed\ndispersal networks is not entirely unexpected given the historical\necological shifts that these species have experienced in the Neotropics.\nUnlike other major tropical regions, such as the Afrotropics and\nSouth-East Asia, the Neotropics had significant post-Pleistocene\nextinctions, which heavily altered mammalian communities. These\nextinctions, which impacted disproportionately to mammal megafauna,\nlikely exacerbate competition and extinction rates among their\nlarge-fruited palm partners, particularly in those regions with high\nmammal diversity and endemism. [@webb2006great; @whiteman2015] into\nConcurrently, the radiation of small-fruited palm taxa\n[@onstein2014diversification; @onstein2017frugivory] further contributed\nto the decoupling of trait diversity between palms and mammals and the\nre-structuring of seed dispersal networks across trophic levels in the\nNeotropics. Without this trait decoupling due the co-evolutionary\ndynamics between palms and mammal frugivores may have remained\nunaltered, fostering otherwise more specialized networks.\n\nThe positive estimate for mean FTA suggests a strong positive influence\nof FTA on H2’, thus promoting network specialization. In contrast, the\nnegative estimate for FTA standard deviation (SD) indicates that a large\nvariation in FTA within SBM group combinations significantly reduces\nH2', implying more generalist interactions. This suggest, that while\noverall higher FTA promotes network specialization, an inconsistent FTA\nacross SBM groups can disrupt this pattern, making network structure\nless predictable from multitrophic trait patterns. Previous research in\ninsular regions where trophic communities are often subject to\nasymmetric filtering strengths have shown that the specialization of\nmutualistic networks can indeed be resilient to shifts in the degree of\necological filters between trophic levels. Particularly, if the networks\nare well supported by generalist species [@schleuning2012specialization\n; @schleuning2016ecological]. It is therefore critical to consider\nchanges in the underlying network structure when evaluating potential\neffects that climate-driven species or species trait losses have in\necosystem function [@acevedo2020structure; @schleuning2020trait;\n@schleuning2023animal, @classen2020specialization]\n\nWe validated the statistic significance of the model parameters through\nnull simulations of network assembly,. However, it is noteworthy that\nour null models are limited to presence/absence permutations. Therefore,\nthe potential influence of varying species relative abundances across\nsites was not considered in this study. It is well established that\npopulation-density dependent effects can modify interaction\nprobabilities from trait matching and range co-occurrences [@pena2023abundance; @donoso2017complementary; @mcfadden2022global]. \nFuture studies should aim to incorporate species abundance estimates\nwhen defining interaction probabilities. However, despite ongoing\nefforts, such data is not readily available for multiple species at\ndifferent trophic levels, and at broad spatial scales. Our results help\nelucidate mechanisms that contribute towards a broader theory of\nmultitrophic community assembly. However, given the current limitation\nin obtaining reliable species abundance data, we advise caution when\nutilizing our data pipelines for making finer-scale spatial predictions\nof network assembly and interaction diversity. Similarly, the use\nbiogeographic domains to delineate the species pools in the construction\nof our null models respects ecological theory and considers both\nhistorical and regional species pools [@mcfadden2022global;\n@carstensen2013introducing; @cornell2014species]. However, one critical\nassumption of this approach is that species within each biogeographic\ndominion are all equally likely to colonize a given community\n[@lessard2012inferring] While this assumption may simplify the\ncomputational complexity of our algorithms, future work could penalize\ndispersal distances with landscape level variables such as the slope\nterrain [@preau2022dispersal; @schlagel2020movement]. Finally, the\nclustering of interactions captured by the SBM may be also capturing\nreveal relatively unexplored drivers of interaction assembly, such as\nphylogenetic niche conservatism [@ackerly2003community;\n@wiens2005niche; @pyron2015phylogenetic], where closely related species\nretain similar ecological traits over evolutionary time, and/or the\nwidespread extinctions of large mammals frugivores and the rapid trait\nspeciation of small fruited palms [@donoso2020downsizing;\n@lim2020frugivore; @onstein2017frugivory] . Partitioning these aspects\nand their relative influences in delineating SBM group assignments can\nbe future research avenues to better understand the underlying\nmechanisms behind mutualistic interaction patterns in space and time.\n\nUnraveling the complexity of network assembly processes across broad\nspatial scales requires continous development and refining of\nstatistical workflows and biodiversity data pipelines that integrate\ndigitally available data from diverse sources [@kissling2012towards;\n@thuiller2024navigating]. Continued field collection, their open-release,\nand data standardization is crucial if we want to expand our capacity to\ntraining models capable of predicting ecological network structures at a\nglobal scale with a high degree of spatial and/or temporal\nresolution[@poisot2016describe; @poisot2021global]. While many of these\nmodelling approaches are in early development, their success hinges on\nthe availability and reliability of foundational data. We have\ndemonstrated that with sparse data across large scales, novel models can\nindeed be developed. Filling global data gaps and leveling data\ncompleteness across species ranges, traits, and interactions can\ncertainly enhance predictive accuracy. While our case study has a\nhistory of digitally available natural history data on both palms and\nmammal frugivores, such comprehensive datasets are not available for\nmany other tropical clades. We thus advocate for increased awareness,\naction, and funding for global biodiversity programs that collect and\ndigitize natural records, thus enabling the continous development of\nlarge-scale spatially explicit predictive models that inform about\nmechanisms of network assembly, and their relationship to climate and\necosystem function.\n\n# Tables\n\nTable 1: Linear regression analysis of the relationship between\nBioclimatic Predictors (Mean Annual Temperature, Total Annual\nPrecipitation, Precipitation Seasonality, Temperature Seasonality) and\nFunctional Trophic Asymmetry within SBM groups (p1m1 - p7m7).\nStatistically significant effects (p\\<0.05) are marked with (\\*).

Each model was evaluated based on its ability to predict interaction probabilities between palm and mammal species pairs.\n\n\n- **1. Stochastic Block Model (SBM):**\n\n  The SBM assumes that ecological networks exhibit a modular pattern, where subsets of species interact more within their groups of highly connected species (Terry and Lewis, 2020).\n\nThe model generates an incidence matrix, \\( Z \\), reflecting species-level associations to a group, and a squared matrix, $( \\Theta )$, reflecting the interaction probabilities within and between groups. The likelihood \\( L \\) of the SBM is given by:\n\n$$\nL = \\prod_{i,j} \\left( \\Theta_{Z_i Z_j} \\right)^{A_{ij}} \\left( 1 - \\Theta_{Z_i Z_j} \\right)^{1 - A_{ij}}\n$$\n\n\nwhere\n\n- $( A )$ is the adjacency matrix of observed interactions,\n- $( Z_i) (Z_j)$ are the group memberships of species \\( i \\) and \\( j \\), and\n- $( \\Theta_{Z_i Z_j} )$ is the probability of interaction between groups \\( Z_i \\) and \\( Z_j \\).\n\n\n\n- **2. Connectance Model:**\n\n\nThe connectance model posits that the interactions of specialist species are subsets of those of generalist species. It optimizes connectivity scores, $( C_i)$, assigned to species to maximize the likelihood of recreating the observed network pattern. The likelihood \\( L \\) for this model is:\n\n$$\nL = \\prod_{i,j} \\left( C_i \\cdot C_j \\right)^{A_{ij}} \\left( 1 - C_i \\cdot C_j \\right)^{1 - A_{ij}}\n$$\n\nwhere $( C_i)$ is the connectivity score of species $(i)$.\n\n\n- **3. Matching-Trait Model:**\n\nThe matching-trait model assumes that species interactions are not random but based on trait differences. It optimizes parameters by scoring interactions along one or multiple latent-trait axes. The interaction probability $( P_{ij})$ between species \\( i \\) and \\( j \\) is determined by:\n\n$$\nP_{ij} = f(T_i, T_j)\n$$\n\nwhere $( T_i)$ and $( T_j)$ are trait vectors for species \\( i \\) and \\( j \\), and \\( f \\) is a function measuring trait similarity or compatibility.\n\n\n\n- **4. Matching-Centrality Model:**\n\nThe matching-centrality model combines the approaches of the connectance and matching-trait models. It optimizes both species connectivity scores and latent trait axes. The likelihood \\( L \\) for this model is:\n\n$$\nL = \\prod_{i,j} \\left( C_i \\cdot C_j \\cdot f(T_i, T_j) \\right)^{A_{ij}} \\left( 1 - C_i \\cdot C_j \\cdot f(T_i, T_j) \\right)^{1 - A_{ij}}\n$$\n\nFollowing the guidelines established by Poisot (2023), Youden's J statistic was used to compare model performance. Youden's J is a metric of model informedness that balances sensitivity and specificity, calculated as:\n\n$$\nJ = \\text{Sensitivity} + \\text{Specificity} - 1\n$$\n\n\n\n\n# Data Accessibility Statement\n\nData is open-source, digitally available at their respective sources. \n\n# Conflict of Interest Statement\n\nThe authors declare no conflict of interest.",
